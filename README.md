# ProjectEuler
This repo contains my solutions to Project Euler.  Project Euler is a series of challenges that require not just programming skill, but also mathematical skills to solve the problems.  Most of the problems would take way to long to brute force every combination, so one has to try and come up with the most effient program to solve the problem.

For the challenges, check out https://projecteuler.net/archives
